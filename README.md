## Adaptive Stiffness Wave Energy Converter
Wave Energy Converters (WECs) are devices that capture the energy from ocean waves and convert it into electricity. They are a promising source of renewable energy, as oceanic wave energy is abundant and has a high power density compared to other sources. While a variety of power take-off mechanisms have been explored for point absorber WECs including hydraulic, mechanical, and direct-drive electromagnetic devices, a key limitation in current approaches comes from the resonant dynamics of the system. The iSSRL seeks to address the narrow-band resonant behavior of typical point absorber WECs by using a mechanically simple hydraulic power takeoff device that can create tunable stiffness (and therefore dynamically adjustable resonant frequency), enabling high output over a broad range of wave periods.

This repository hosts simulation models related to the iSSRL Adaptive Stiffness WEC project.
